# Task Manager
-This program allows you to add and manage your tasks,they are stored in a dictionary in a json file

-When executed, the program will generate a screen with several options for the user, which mainly aims to manipulate or show tasks on the list.

FEATURES
- add new tasks with a specific status, which can be of three types: completed, not completed or in progress (as the project is not yet complete, the user must enter it manually)
- the user can remove any task they want
- change the status of any task

- show the status of a given task
- show a complete list of all tasks and also only tasks of a certain status

The project is not yet complete, especially in exception handling. But I'm working daily to finish it and make it as functional as possible.
